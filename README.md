## Project Overview  
FTK_AI_Auto (Fast Toolkit AI Automation) is a powerful multimedia processing and automation toolset, focusing on video and audio processing as well as intelligent editing.  

This tool integrates a variety of advanced AI technologies, covering the entire process of video, audio, and editing. Its core capabilities include **‚ú® AI editing, AI special effects, and intelligent dubbing**, etc. It has built-in practical functions such as horizontal/vertical screen classification, scene slicing, action clip extraction, subtitle addition, and timbre conversion, and supports **üöÄ out-of-the-box zero configuration**.  

It is deeply optimized for 12G VRAM devices and Mac M-series chips, which can accurately release hardware performance, making AI-driven multimedia creation efficient and smooth.

## Feature List  
The project's functions are divided into video, audio, and editing categories as follows:  

### üé¨ 1. Video Functions  
- Horizontal/vertical screen classification: Classify materials by horizontal/vertical screen, and store videos and pictures in corresponding folders respectively  
- Video scene slicing: Split videos into clips by scene, name them standardizedly and add duration information  
- Video duration slicing: Batch split videos into clips of specified duration  
- Quick video frame extraction: Extract image sequences from videos, with options to set start time, frame interval, and total number of frames  
- Extract video first and last frames: Extract the first frame, last frame, or both according to options, and save them in order  
- Batch video description: Read videos in batches and generate descriptions, saved in JSON format  
- Batch extraction of action clips: Detect key frames of actions in videos, intercept clips according to specified length, with file name prefix as action description  
- Audio-to-video lip-sync: Sync lip movements in videos according to audio (requires NVIDIA graphics card support)  
- Batch image-to-video generation: Generate videos based on images and text prompts, with adjustable size and duration  
- Batch image-to-video generation (first and last frames): Generate smoothly transitional videos through two images (first frame/last frame) + text  


### üîä 2. Audio Functions  
- Batch audio extraction: Extract audio in batches from video materials  
- Batch audio splitting: Split audio materials into clips of specified duration in batches  
- Batch audio timbre conversion: Convert audio to specified timbre in batches, supporting single-person voice/singing, with adjustable pitch  
- Batch addition of background sound effects: Generate background sound effects according to video content and add them to videos  
- Text-to-custom timbre voice: Convert text to audio with custom timbre, supporting batch generation of reading effects with multiple reference timbres  


### ‚úÇÔ∏è 3. Editing Functions  
- Batch video subtitle addition: Add subtitles to videos in batches, supporting custom fonts, sizes, colors, alignment, and optional watermark addition  
- Batch text translation: Read TXT files in batches and translate them into Chinese  
- Batch JSON translation: Read JSON files in batches and translate specified fields into Chinese
